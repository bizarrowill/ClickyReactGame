# Pick a Pro - Clicky React Memory Game

* Try to get the highest score by clicking on top NFL QB's of today and yesterday 

* This app was built with React.js and deployed through Github Pages. The   goal was to get practice building components and working with the basics of React to begin creating dynamic applications with the M.E.R.N. stack.


This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).
